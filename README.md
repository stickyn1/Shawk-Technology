* Initial version.

== Installation ==

No special instructions.

== NOTES ABOUT PLUGIN ==
This plugin was simply made to provide an easy way to insert data to the wp_usermeta table from the user profile. It will need a user interface to
use the plugin. Now as i have it, all you can do is manually edit the file to show tables. I would like to expand on this in the near future.
